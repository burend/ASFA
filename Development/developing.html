<p>To develop for this game you need to be aware of the code structure</p>
<p>All location/event code is compiled into a single file Javascripts/compiledplaces.js</p>
<p>The source for this is in Javascripts/Places(Source) and there is a bat file that creates the combined file using the Google Closure Compiler or simple copy commands. I leave it as an exercise for those using a unix based OS to convert to a bash script. Not this process just combines the files and does a simple whitespace strip.</p>
<p>So the process is edit the js file, and then run the compile script, and test.</p>

	alternate white border is css

- If you charm Dianne but not Kerry, she still lets you go.

- You can Take Tina into the seance, and she is able to leave even if the player can't. (Maybe make it so followers can't enter Jessica's Prison?)

- When you cast pass on Rathdown road, you are moved to Gina's front door, not inside her house.

- During the Seance, Kurndorf's picture occasionally shows up twice, Jessica's picture is also rather small while Jesse's is pretty big


[b]Suggestions:
[/b]
- Having to cast clairvoyance at the graveyard to find the Mausoleum might be one of these things where people say you need a guide. I don't think that there is any hint in the game that you can find a secret entrance into the church there.

- When you try to charm the campers, the text just mentions that the spell fizzles, maybe it could point out that you can't charm them as a group.
Regarding that, I had an Idea that one of them could secretly slip the player her phone number to get a date, allowing for her to be charmed alone and to enlist her help to get the other two. (All models have Solo pictures at the campsite)

A small update:

I had intended for Jessica to have 2 sexscenes when free and wrote the 2nd one. There is also an alternative hardcore picture for one of the bondage scenes using Alexa Nova.

Heya, 

[b]General Bugs[/b]
[spoiler]
- You can leave the Gates Mansion at night, but not reenter it, keeping you trapped in front of it after the clearing becomes dangerous.

-When confronting Davy with Kate, the player seems to be immune to his magic even without the pendant or Mana.

- Charming Bambi seems to move Monique into the History classroom for the “Ask Monique what she is doing back at school” line (Information about the Sears family) Sending her out to look for magic opens up the “Ask Monique if she has found anything” line at the same place (A stone and information on Hydromancy)

If both are Triggered at the same time picking the first line sends her home, she leaves the Classroom and you won't be able to pick the 2nd line.

- When you give Mom the suitcase, and she asks about the underwear, the speech-bubble should be a little higher so it covers what Gabby says after Mom spoke. Or maybe it's best to not use a speechbubble at all for that part.

- Playing it now again, I think Nina's phone-call after delivering the suitcase to Mom would look better as one of the large popups with a picture of Nina on the phone.

- If you do anything but talk to charmed Nina immediately after visiting Mom, you'll no longer be able to talk to her about Mom at all. It's when the player gets the hint to pass into the studio at night, so it should be available until they do so. The option to Listen in on her phone-call can remain time limited, though.

- The flavortext for the “People here” during the Press conference is only working in the main hall, not when you speak to Sarah or Mayor Thomas.

- I'm now able to free Leanne during the Day.

- Likewise, Nurse Sandra never showed up for me.

- I'm unable to do bondage play with Victoria during the day after charming Nella, (Might be intentional, she does need to tend to her store after all)

- If you leave the store and enter it again the Conversation starts anew as well.

[b]Thoughts about game difficulty.[/b]
[spoiler]
- In thew Game threat, HCCorvin mentioned that during exploration, people generally click everything that doesn't obviously start something bad, which may end up blocking you in some part, and I think he made a good point, especially in regards to options that don't trigger an immediate game over.

The Vampire plotline is maybe the biggest offender here. After asking Sarah why she is looking out of the window and waiting for the night, you don't necessarily have to give her the book. If you don't and protect her via the twin souls or garlic, though, you no longer have the option to protect her the next night. After one more day, she'll die, even if you are there, and visiting her again will get you a game over, but that visit might happen weeks after the original event, if you are unlucky.

Adding an option to protect her the next night as well might help, maybe with an SMS reminder from Sarah to hurry back. Or you could give more control as to when the Vampire attacks for the first time.

- I was trying to remember parts I had problems with during my first playthrough. And If I remember correctly I had to use the guide for both Kurndorf's crypt and finding the secret path into the Church.

For the Church, I'm not sure if there's a hint that you need to search the graveyard for an entry is hidden anywhere in the game, if not, it could be added and placed in the player notes as well.[/spoiler]

[b]Random thoughts[/b]
[spoiler]
- I don't think I have ever been able to get the Blue bottle before facing Davy in a single playthrough, and it seems to be no longer needed to defeat him. Maybe the bottle could serve a new purpose of draining his power and finally allowing him to be charmed?

- Jessica's picture is often very small once she's in the cellar with Davy. Maybe display them on top of each other and not next to each other?

- When you “speak to Mom” before freeing her or charming her, it might be good to add a clear hint towards the Pendant:

Better to make sure either free of Gabby’s influence or otherwise protected. You could probably use Gabby's Necklace for this.

- Ellie calls Kristin her Aunt when she is at her home. Is this a leftover from older content where they were related or just a sign of familiarity?

- Come to think of it, Beasley knows how to use the Dai Chu once he has the book, so he's a warlock. Shouldn't he have green eyes? Same for the player when they get charmed.

- With Davy and Jessica in the Cellar, it might be a good idea to add a way to choose who to tend to reduce clutter when selecting play options.[/spoiler]

- After Bambi's mother decides to stay, you can ask Bambi about her career for a 2nd time.
