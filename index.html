	<p><b>Your character</b></p>
	<p>You can select here the name of your character, your gender as a male, female or futanari (fully functional hermaphrodite), and the avatar. The model you select for your avatar will affect some images used for your character in the game. The images are not used often except at the top left of the screen.</p>
	<p><b>General Game Settings</b></p>
	<p>These setting affect how the game plays out, and many can be changed during the course of the game. Open your phone and use the 'Apps' icon and here you can toggle on or off most of these settings unless otherwise noted.</p>
	<p><b>Explicit Content:</b> Unless selected images in the game are limited to R rated images with nudity and non-explicit sex scenes. If selected the full hardcore images are also shown</p>
	<p><b>Glenvale in the UK:</b> The game is either set in the United Kingdoms or in the United States. Some different images and some characters use completely different models between the settings. Terms like currency, legal terminology and age of consent for drinking differs in these settings. All major elements of gameplay are otherwise unaffected. <b>Cannot be changed after the start of game.</b></p>
	<p><b>Riddles:</b> At times in the game you will be asked to solve some riddles, passwords or similar. If you choose you do not like them then you will never be asked these, your character will automatically solve them.</p>
	<p><b>Rune Matching:</b> When you learn spells a system to compare runic symbols/text will be used. Otherwise a search and type system will be used.</p>
	<p><b>Know Glenvale:</b> The default is the town will be explored in game play, and areas opened up as you need to visit them. If you know the town well then you will at the start know all public/non-secret locations in the town. Gameplay is otherwise unaffected. <b>Cannot be changed after the start of game.</b></p>
	<p><b>Easier Mode:</b> If selected you will gain mana faster to power spells and you will have the ability to undo some dire actions that would end the game without loading an earlier save game. <b>Cannot be changed after the start of game.</b></p>
